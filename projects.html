					<p>
						Developed for a startup, Harba is a app due to launch May 1. 2016, and is a Androi/iOS application that makes it easier for the end user to book a spot at a Harbor.<br />

						It also makes it so that harbors can use less time managing bookings by having payment and notifications automated<br />
						<br />
						I facillitated the development and design of the application, and executed the coding of it.
