						Developed for the Norwegian firm Mills, we build an application that works like jibjab.com, slightly simpler tho. The user could select 4 Facebook friends/images and adjust the image onto a face which then was featured in a party video where we animated the friend faces onto actors so it would seem as they where in the video.<br />

						This is not one of my prouder moments, as we hit a lot of walls during production, but the app ended up working and is definitely a proof that the web can be used for interesting things, hence why i am listing it here.<br />
						<br /> 
						For the german firm Ültje we developed a Facebook application that allowed 1, or 2 people together on different computers, to record a video of them self as a nut, complete with image manipulation to put their face on the nut. The nut was controller via facetracking, and the mouth was controlled via the microphone(Southpark Canada style!). After recording either as a single person or as 2 people. the video got the recoded voices pitched via flash and the video was then added to a gallery.<br />
						<br />
						Quite a mouthfull... anyway Ültje selected the funniest videos and rewarded the users with prices.
